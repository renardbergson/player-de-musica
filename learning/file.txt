    Tag Progress and it's atributes: "value" and "end"

    Tag Input, type "range" and it's atributes, "value", "range" and "value"

CSS 
    "Touch-action" property

JS
    Functions to review: play(), pause (), getComputedStyle()
    
    Properties: 
        .style.display = (makes the style of an element)
        style.backgroundImage
        .value = (returns the value of an element)
        .duration = (returns the duration of an element in seconds)
        .currentTime = (returns the current time of an element)
            .currentTime / .duration = the decimal value of an element
            (.currentTime / .duration) * 100 = the percentual value of an element
        Math.floor() rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer
            Math.floor ((.currentTime / .duration) * 100) + '%' is the nearest number integer of an element
        .volume = (returns the volume of an element)
        .setatribute = (Add a class attribute to an element)
        .click() = simulates a mouse-click on an element

    Events:
        'ontimeupdate' (executes an action when the current playback position has changed)
        'onchange' (execute an action when the user changes the selected element)
        'onloadeddata' (executes an action when data for the current item is available)

    How to get MINUTES?
        - divide (/) minutes per 60 (seconds) and get the result DOWN with Math.floor method
            ex: 40 / 60 = 0.666...
            ex: Math.floor(40 / 60) = 0 minutes

    How to get SECONDS?
        - use the division remainder operator (%) to divide per 60
            ex: 40 % 60 = 40
            ex: 60 % 60 = 0
            * Every number above 60 returns the result 0 and every number under 60 returns itself *

    Problems founded and solved
        - current time needs to be in a "timeupdate" event 
        - total time needs to be in a "loadeddata" event
        - input type "range" works better with events type "input" in JS
